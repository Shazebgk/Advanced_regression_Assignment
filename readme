# Ridge Regression Model for House Price Prediction

This repository contains a Ridge Regression model trained to predict house prices based on various features.

## Model
The model is saved in the file `ridge_regression_model.joblib`. It was trained on a dataset containing information about houses and their sale prices.

## Usage
To use the model for making predictions, follow these steps:

1. Load the model using `joblib`:
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('ridge_regression_model.joblib')
```

2. Prepare your input data in the same format as the training data. Ensure that all categorical variables are encoded appropriately.

3. Make predictions:
```python
predictions = model.predict(input_data)
```

## Requirements
- scikit-learn
- joblib
